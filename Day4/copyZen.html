      <h2>THE ROAD TO ENLIGHTENMENT</h2>
      <p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of
        browser-specific
        tags,
        <!-- new line and space --> incompatible <abbr
          title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>s, broken
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> support, and abandoned
        browsers.
      </p>
      <p>
        We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved
        thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the <abbr
          title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>,
        <abbr title="Web Standards Project">WASP</abbr>, and the major browser
        creators.
      </p>

      <p>
        The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important
        lessons of the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the
        time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one with
        the web.

      <h2>SO WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?</h2>
      <p>There is a continuing need to show the power of
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. The Zen Garden aims to
        excite,inspire,and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the
        existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style
        sheet into this very page. The <a href="#">HTML</a> remains the same,
        the only thing that has changed is the external
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> file. Yes, really.
      </p>

      <p>
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> allows complete and
        total
        control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way this can
        be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating
        what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those
        able to create beauty from structure. Desingers and coders alike have
        contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.
      </p>

      <h2>PARTICIPATION</h2>
      <p>
        Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this
        page, so strong <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> skills
        are necessary too, but the
        example files are commented well enough that even <abbr
          title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>
        novices can use them as starting points. Please see the <abbr
          title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> really can be. This site
        servers
        as equal parts inspiration for those working on the web today, learning
        tool for those who will be tomorrow, and gallery of future techniques we
        can all look forward to.

      <h2>REQUIREMENTS</h2>
      <p>Where possible, we would like to see mostly <abbr
          title="Cascading Style Sheets, levels 1 and 2">CSS 1&2</abbr>
        usage. <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets, levels 3 and 4">CSS 3 &
          4</abbr>
        should be limited to widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks
        should
        be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about functional, practical <abbr
          title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>
        and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing
        public. The only
        real requirement we have is that your <abbr
          title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>
        validates.
      </p>
      <p>
        Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have
        implemented
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> by now. When sticking to
        the
        guildelines you should see fairly consistent results across most morden
        browsers.
        Due to the sheer number of user agents on the web thest days -
        especially when you factor in mobile - pixel-perfect layouts may not be
        possible across every platform. That's okay, but do test in as many as
        you can. your design should work in at least IE9+ and the lastest
        Chrome, Firefox, iOS
        and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population).
      </p>
      <p>
        We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copying laws.
        Please keep objectionable material to a minimum, and try to incorporate
        unique and interesting visual themes to your work. We're well past the
        point of needing another garden-related design.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full
        copyright on your graphics (with limited exceptions, see <a
          href="#">submission guidelines</a>), but we ask you release your <abbr
          title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> under a Creative Commons
        license identical
        to the <a href="#">one on this site</a> so that others may learn from
        your work.
